I help you find foosball opponents! Join the queue and when matched, you can accept or decline.

**Commands:**
‚Ä¢ `/queue` - Join the foosball queue
‚Ä¢ `/unqueue` - Leave the foosball queue
‚Ä¢ `/accept` - Accept a match proposal
‚Ä¢ `/decline` - Decline a match proposal
‚Ä¢ `/status` - Check how many players are in the queue
‚Ä¢ `/help` - Show this help message

When 2 players are in the queue, you'll both receive a match proposal. Both players must accept within 2 minutes to confirm the match!"""
